<h2 id="courses-on-the-roadmap">Courses on the Roadmap</h2>
<p>Two planned courses will extend the ability set:</p>
<p><strong>Innovation for Social Impact</strong> <em>(Target: Fall
2026)</em> — <strong>(?)</strong> Expected to develop Learn from Others
and Synthesize and Frame in the context of social systems, and to
introduce the belief that innovation and social impact reinforce each
other.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Generation for Entrepreneurs</strong> <em>(Target:
Spring 2027)</em> — <strong>(?)</strong> Expected to develop Build and
Ship and Model and Measure toward distribution, sales, and revenue, and
to introduce the belief that revenue is a form of validation that tells
you something free signups can't.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-to-read-this-map">How to Read This Map</h2>
<p><strong>The Abilities</strong> are organized from most broadly shared
across the curriculum to most specialized. "Introduced" means students
encounter the ability for the first time. "Practiced" means they apply
it with increasing independence. "Deepened" means it becomes
professional-grade or self-directed.</p>
<p><strong>The Beliefs</strong> are grouped by theme rather than by
course, to show the cumulative worldview the Lilie curriculum builds.
Course names in parentheses indicate where each belief is most strongly
developed.</p>
<p>Items marked <strong>(?)</strong> are best guesses to be corrected
and filled in.</p>
