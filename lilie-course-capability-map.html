<p><strong>“What they can do coming in”</strong> = prerequisite
capabilities, what students typically arrive with. This helps understand
who the course is designed for.</p>
<p><strong>“What they can do after”</strong> = demonstrable skills and
actions. These are things a student could show someone, not just talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>“What they believe after”</strong> = mindset shifts, identity
changes, internalized beliefs. These are drawn from the Lilie Beliefs
document where possible, supplemented with reasonable inferences from
syllabi.</p>
<p>Items marked <strong>(?)</strong> are best guesses to be corrected
and filled in.</p>

Beliefs document, and the Lilie Academic Roadmap.</em></p>
