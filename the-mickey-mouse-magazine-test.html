<h1 id="the-mickey-mouse-magazine-test">The Mickey Mouse Magazine
Test</h1>
<p>Every evening, a dental technician in Germany would sit down at the
dinner table with his wife and two sons. But they weren’t eating. They
were playtesting.</p>
<p>Klaus Teuber spent his days making dental crowns and bridges. At
night, he designed board games. For years, his family was his only test
audience. His wife and sons would sit through prototype after prototype,
rolling dice, moving pieces, trying to find the fun in whatever Klaus
had cooked up that week.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always fun.</p>
<p>Klaus had a tell for whether a game was working. His youngest son
Benjamin always had a Mickey Mouse magazine within arm’s reach. If
Benjamin started flipping through cartoon pages instead of paying
attention to the board, the game wasn’t good enough. The magazine was
the test.</p>
<p>There were games so bad that Klaus’s wife would leave the table to go
do laundry. But he kept going. He kept watching his family for signals —
the body language, the drifting attention, the moments when they leaned
in versus when they checked out.</p>
<p>One of those prototypes became The Settlers of Catan. It took four
years of dinner table playtests to get there. The breakthrough? Swapping
square tiles for hexagonal ones. From there, Klaus refined the game
through hundreds of family sessions until it became the version that has
now <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/11/us/creating-catan-board-games-card-cec">sold
over 40 million copies</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>He wasn’t trying to design a hit. He was trying to design a game his
son wouldn’t walk away from.</p>
<hr />
<p>Almost a decade ago, a software engineer named Josh Wardle built a
prototype of a word-guessing game. He shelved it.</p>
<p>Years later, during COVID, Wardle and his partner Palak Shah had
gotten obsessed with the New York Times Spelling Bee. He dusted off the
old prototype and rebuilt it — not for a product launch, but as a gift
for her.</p>
<p>Palak’s contribution is the part that gets me. She went through all
12,000 five-letter words in the English language and narrowed the list
down to about 2,500. By hand. One word at a time. She wasn’t running a
focus group or testing with strangers. She was picking words that felt
right to her. And because the word list was filtered through one
person’s actual vocabulary, the game never felt obscure. You never got a
word and thought <em>who the hell uses that word?</em></p>
<p>From January to June 2021, they played Wordle alone. Just the two of
them, every day, for six months. Then he shared it with family. In
October, he put it on his personal website. 90 players on November 1st.
Over 2 million by early January.</p>
<p>Wardle later said: <em>“The game has gotten bigger than I ever
imagined, which I suppose isn’t a feat since I made the game for an
audience of one.”</em></p>
<p>The New York Times acquired it for a seven-figure sum. The newspaper
that inspired the game ended up buying it.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>An audience of one.</em></p>
<p>Rick Rubin has this line: <em>“We are performing for an audience of
one.”</em></p>
<p>The Teuber family sitting around the dinner table? Audience of four.
Wardle and Shah playing Wordle at home during a pandemic? Audience of
one. In both stories, the person building the thing was also the person
using it. They didn’t need anyone to tell them whether it was working.
They could feel it.</p>
<p>I came across something recently from <a
href="https://www.alephic.com/writing/software-for-one">Noah Brier</a>,
a product builder and writer, about what he calls “software for one.”
With AI tools, the gap between having an idea and building it has nearly
disappeared. Noah built a fully functional website — a curated directory
of brands he admired — for about $100 in AI tokens. For himself. He used
it, noticed what felt off, fixed it. Same night.</p>
<p>What Teuber needed four years and a captive family for, what Wardle
needed six months and a partner for, Noah did in an evening. The
feedback loop is the same — build, use, feel what’s wrong, adjust — but
the cycle time keeps shrinking.</p>
<hr />
<p>In our design courses, we talk about <a
href="https://hes.am/essays/start-at-the-extreme/">starting at the
extreme</a>. The idea is that the best insights don’t come from the
middle of a bell curve. They come from the edges. The parent juggling a
screaming baby while grocery shopping. The productivity enthusiast with
five different note-taking systems. People with amplified needs who show
you things you’d never see if you only talked to the average person.</p>
<p>But what if you’re the extreme user? What if the market of one is
you?</p>
<p>Klaus Teuber wasn’t designing for the global board game market. He
was designing for his family. Palak Shah wasn’t optimizing a word list
for millions of players. She was picking words she knew.</p>
<p>When you build for yourself, you have something most founders would
kill for: perfect information about what you need. You don’t have to
guess. You know instantly whether the thing you made is any good — or
whether you’re reaching for the Mickey Mouse magazine.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m sharing this because I know some of you are in a spot right now
where the pressure to build something big and scalable feels real. Maybe
you abandoned an idea mid-sprint and you’re spinning about what to build
next. Maybe you feel like you can’t build anything without first talking
to dozens of users.</p>
<p>Sit with this for a moment.</p>
<p>Klaus Teuber iterated on Catan for four years before anyone outside
his family saw it. Josh Wardle and his partner played Wordle alone for
six months. Neither of them started by trying to make something for
everyone. They started by making something for themselves, and the work
revealed itself as they went.</p>
<p>Build something you would use. Something small that scratches an itch
you actually have. Test it on yourself. If you find yourself reaching
for your phone instead of engaging with what you built, that’s useful
information. And if you can’t put it down, pay attention to that
too.</p>
<p>The distance between ideas and execution has never been shorter.
Don’t wait for permission from a market. Be the extreme user of one.</p>
<p>And when it passes the Mickey Mouse magazine test — when the thing
you built holds your own attention — that’s when you’ll know it’s worth
showing to someone else.</p>
