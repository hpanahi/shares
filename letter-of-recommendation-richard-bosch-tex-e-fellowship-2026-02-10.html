Fellowship Recommendation - Richard Bosch</h1>

1: Describe an example of how the applicant demonstrates leadership,
creativity, or initiative and how would that experience relate to
TEX-E’s mission of addressing an energy or climate challenge that
supports Texas’ role in energy innovation.</h2>
<p>Richard was a student of mine in two courses: New Enterprises:
Discovery, a needfinding course where students identify real needs and
opportunities in the world, and iSEED Japan, a study abroad program
where students travel to Tokyo to explore design and innovation.</p>
<p>While in Tokyo, Richard led a team that constructed a prototype and
took it to Shibuya Crossing — the busiest intersection in the world — to
test it on complete strangers. Getting a team to approach people they’ve
never met, in a foreign country, in a language they don’t speak, takes a
specific kind of leadership. Richard didn’t hesitate. He pushed his team
to embrace the discomfort, and they followed his lead.</p>
<p>What excites me most about Richard is how deeply curious he is about
energy and climate technology. While in Tokyo, he went out on his own to
learn about sustainability innovations like Maglev trains and other
technologies. Nobody told him to do this. He did it because he genuinely
wanted to understand how these technologies worked. He came back and
educated me about what he had learned — I had to look things up after
our conversation. Richard is a sophomore studying Electrical and
Computer Engineering with a concentration in AI and Systems. That
technical background, paired with the kind of curiosity that sends him
across Tokyo chasing down how Maglev trains work, is exactly what the
TEX-E fellowship is looking for.</p>
<h2
id="prompt-2-how-does-the-applicant-collaborate-with-others-or-contribute-to-a-team">Prompt
2: How does the applicant collaborate with others or contribute to a
team?</h2>
<p>Richard is a unifying force. In every team setting I’ve observed him
in, he is the person that brings people together. He has an energy that
is infectious and constant — it never seems to stop. But Richard isn’t
just enthusiastic. He is kind, and he is also disciplined. He holds
himself and his teammates to a high standard while making sure everyone
around him feels like they’re part of something.</p>
<p>In New Enterprises: Discovery, Richard’s team was given a challenge
where they had to go out to Rice Village and gather feedback from people
about a problem they were exploring. Richard approached this with ease.
He walked up to strangers without hesitation, asked thoughtful
questions, and genuinely cared about what he was learning. He wasn’t
going through the motions — he wanted to understand people. In Tokyo, he
led his team to Shibuya Crossing to test their prototype. He was the one
who pushed the group forward, but he did it in a way where everyone felt
like they were in it together. Richard is a peacekeeper. He brings calm
to chaotic situations and focus to ambiguous ones. Teams work better
when Richard is on them.</p>
<h2
id="prompt-3-please-share-any-observations-on-the-applicants-growth-potential-and-integrity.">Prompt
3: Please share any observations on the applicant’s growth potential and
integrity.</h2>
<p>Richard is a sophomore, and he is already operating at a level that I
typically see in juniors and seniors. He is studying Electrical and
Computer Engineering with a concentration in AI and Systems — a
foundation that is only going to become more relevant in the energy
space. But what stands out about Richard is his curiosity and his
willingness to go beyond what’s asked.</p>
<p>While in Tokyo for iSEED, Richard took it upon himself to visit sites
related to sustainability innovations like Maglev trains and other
technologies. Nobody assigned this. He sought it out because he wanted
to learn. He came back with knowledge that he eagerly shared, teaching
me about technologies I wasn’t familiar with. That’s a sophomore doing
this on his own time, in a foreign country — that tells you a lot about
where he’s headed.</p>
<p>Richard genuinely cares about doing good work and doing right by the
people around him. In both of my courses, he showed up ready to go every
single time. He didn’t cut corners. When his team needed someone to step
up and do the uncomfortable thing — approaching strangers for feedback,
leading a group into an unfamiliar situation — Richard was that person.
He did it not for recognition, but because it needed to be done.</p>
<h2
id="prompt-4-this-fellowship-will-require-a-year-long-commitment-from-the-applicant-to-serve-as-an-active-ambassador-on-their-campus-and-take-initiative-in-engaging-meaningfully-with-the-tex-e-ecosystem.-please-share-your-thoughts-on-the-applicant-fulfilling-this-commitment.">Prompt
4: This fellowship will require a year-long commitment from the
applicant to serve as an active ambassador on their campus and take
initiative in engaging meaningfully with the TEX-E ecosystem. Please
share your thoughts on the applicant fulfilling this commitment.</h2>
<p>I have no concerns about Richard’s ability to fulfill this
commitment. I expect him to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>Across two courses with me, Richard consistently did more than what
was asked. He didn’t just complete assignments — he went looking for
more. When his team in Tokyo needed someone to lead them into an
uncomfortable situation, Richard stepped up without being asked. When he
was curious about energy and sustainability technologies in Japan, he
went and found them on his own time.</p>
<p>Richard is the kind of person who won’t just show up to things —
he’ll make things happen. He brings people together and makes everyone
around him feel like they’re part of the group. As a sophomore, he has
the time to make a real impact within the TEX-E ecosystem over the
coming years. His interest in energy, climate tech, and sustainability
is real — it’s something he talks about with genuine excitement and
depth in our conversations. I am confident he will represent Rice
well.</p>
