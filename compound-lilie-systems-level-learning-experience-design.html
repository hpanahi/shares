id="compound-lilie-systems-level-learning-experience-design">Compound
Lilie: Systems-Level Learning Experience Design</h1>
<p><em>Extending Compound Learning Experience Design from course-level
to institutional-level thinking.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-1-the-premise">Part 1: The Premise</h2>
<p>Kieran Klaassen’s insight in Compound Engineering is deceptively
simple: “A system that produces code is more valuable than any
individual piece of code.” Replace one word and the premise for Lilie
becomes clear:</p>
<p><strong>A system that produces learning experiences is more valuable
than any individual course.</strong></p>
<p>The difference matters. A course that improves semester over semester
is good. A <em>system</em> that compounds — where every design decision,
every faculty observation, every student reflection makes the entire
ecosystem permanently smarter — is something else entirely.</p>
<p>The Compound Learning Experience Design note already maps this at the
course level: compound ledgers that capture design decisions with the
fix <em>and the reason</em>, grading agents that accumulate calibration
data, capability handoffs between courses. That work is real and it’s
already happening.</p>
<p>But all of it operates within individual courses or the connections
between them. None of it addresses the question one level up: does Lilie
itself compound?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-2-where-lilie-already-compounds-and-where-it-doesnt">Part
2: Where Lilie Already Compounds (and Where It Doesn’t)</h2>
<h3 id="what-already-exists">What Already Exists</h3>
<p>Lilie has institutional taste. It’s real. You can feel it in how
courses are designed, how faculty talk to students, how the program
positions itself relative to traditional academic departments. The taste
lives in several places:</p>
<p><strong>The Teaching Manifesto</strong> — Eight principles that
define Lilie’s identity: 1. The experience matters (ungoogleable wisdom,
not commoditized lectures) 2. We recognize the whole student 3. Process
matters most in evaluation 4. We experiment to get better 5. Rigorous
AND inspiring 6. Collapse the hierarchy — we are approachable 7. Courses
are portals to the larger Lilie community 8. Students are navigating
ambiguity with courage, and we support that</p>
<p><strong>The First Principles for Venture Creation at Lilie</strong> —
Pedagogical commitments for the venture creation courses: AI as thinking
partner with humans in the loop, accept teams at any stage, minimize the
gap between real-world velocity and classroom pace, go beyond
traditional customer discovery, support urgency, be an energy
amplifier.</p>
<p><strong>Course Design Philosophies</strong> — The DBS Course Design
Philosophy encodes nine principles drawing on Farza, Jason Fried, Simon
Sarris, Unreasonable Hospitality, and TLS. The Intro to Design and Disco
courses have their own evolving design documents.</p>
<p><strong>Language Conventions</strong> — “Builder” not “student.”
“Ship” not “submit.” “Faculty” not “instructor.” These aren’t just
preferences; they signal identity and values.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle’s Practices</strong> — Priority and care for founders,
removal of friction, proactive accountability, not infantilizing
entrepreneurship. These live in how Kyle operates, not in a
document.</p>
<h3 id="the-gap">The Gap</h3>
<p>All of this exists. None of it is connected. There is no capture →
encode → verify loop at the institutional level.</p>
<p>The Teaching Manifesto is aspirational but static. Principle IV
literally says “we experiment to get better” — but there is no system
for capturing what those experiments taught. When a faculty member
discovers that a particular activity transforms the room, where does
that knowledge go? Into their memory. When they leave or the semester
ends, the lesson goes with them.</p>
<p>The First Principles document captures beliefs, not design patterns.
It says <em>what we value</em> but not <em>what we do differently
because of those values</em>, or <em>what we tried that didn’t
work</em>. The Course User Guides work is starting to address this — but
it’s early, and it’s happening course by course, not system-wide.</p>
<h3 id="the-9010-problem">The 90/10 Problem</h3>
<p>Klaassen’s 50/50 rule says half of engineering time should go to
improving the system, not just shipping features. Lilie’s ratio is
closer to 90/10, and it’s a bandwidth issue, not a choice. Almost all
energy goes to running programs — teaching courses, managing
co-curriculars, advising students, administering the program. System
improvement happens in gaps that rarely exist.</p>
<p>Faculty alignment sessions happen occasionally. Course user guides
are being developed. The capability handoff concept is emerging. But all
of this is extra — the first thing to get cut when the semester gets
busy. System improvement has no structural home at Lilie.</p>
<p>This is exactly the dynamic Klaassen describes: “Work that isn’t a
feature feels like distraction — something done with spare time (which
never exists).” For Lilie, read: work that isn’t directly serving
students feels like a luxury.</p>
<h3 id="current-stage-between-0-and-1">Current Stage: Between 0 and
1</h3>
<p>Faculty mostly design alone. Shared principles exist but aren’t
operationalized. The Teaching Manifesto is referenced but not enforced
through structure. Faculty are just starting to design the connections
between Lilie’s offerings.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-3-the-mapping-compound-engineering-compound-lilie">Part 3:
The Mapping — Compound Engineering → Compound Lilie</h2>
<p>The Compound Learning Experience Design note mapped the analogy at
the course level. Here is the systems-level mapping:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The most interesting parallel might be the last one. Klaassen asks
three questions before accepting AI output — designed to surface the
thinking behind the work, not just the work itself. What if Lilie asked
the same three questions before every course design got finalized? Not
as compliance, but as a compound ritual: the answers become permanent
institutional knowledge about <em>how design decisions get made
here</em>.</p>
<h3 id="where-the-analogy-breaks">Where the Analogy Breaks</h3>
<p>The table above presents the mapping cleanly. It’s not clean.</p>
<p>Software systems don’t have egos. A codebase doesn’t resist being
refactored. When Klaassen encodes a pattern into CLAUDE.md, the system
doesn’t feel threatened — it just gets better. Faculty are not agents.
They have identities, creative investments, years of hard-won intuition.
Encoding a faculty member’s best teaching moves into a course user guide
isn’t like extracting a coding pattern into a config file. It’s more
like asking a chef to write down the recipe for the dish they cook by
feel — and then telling them someone else will cook it.</p>
<p>Code is also deterministic in a way that teaching isn’t. A
well-encoded software pattern produces the same result every time. A
well-encoded teaching pattern — “use the paper clip challenge to teach
value creation” — produces wildly different outcomes depending on who’s
in the room, what energy they bring, what happened ten minutes before.
The system can encode <em>what</em> to do; it cannot encode the judgment
about <em>whether this is the right moment to do it</em>.</p>
<p>And software compounds continuously — every commit, every merged PR.
Teaching compounds in semester-long cycles with months of lag between
action and feedback. You can’t A/B test a course design the way you test
a feature flag. By the time you know whether an encoded lesson actually
improved outcomes, you’ve already designed the next semester.</p>
<p>These aren’t reasons to abandon the analogy. They’re reasons to hold
it honestly: compound engineering gives Lilie a vocabulary and a
structure, but the domain demands patience, humility about what’s
encodable, and respect for the parts of teaching that resist
systematization.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-4-the-five-stages-for-lilie">Part 4: The Five Stages for
Lilie</h2>
<p>Klaassen describes five adoption stages for compound engineering.
Mapped to Lilie:</p>
<h3 id="stage-0-manual-development-each-faculty-designs-alone">Stage 0:
Manual Development → Each Faculty Designs Alone</h3>
<p>Every course is its own world. Faculty bring their expertise and
experience, but there’s no shared system for how courses are designed.
Knowledge lives in heads.</p>
<h3
id="stage-1-chat-based-assistance-shared-principles-exist-and-are-referenced">Stage
1: Chat-Based Assistance → Shared Principles Exist and Are
Referenced</h3>
<p>The Teaching Manifesto and First Principles exist. Faculty can
reference them. They influence design the way a helpful article
influences coding — useful context, but the work is still entirely
manual. You know the principles, but they don’t structure your design
process.</p>
<p><strong>This is roughly where Lilie is now — between 0 and
1.</strong></p>
<h3
id="stage-2-agentic-tools-with-line-by-line-review-course-user-guides-encode-design-decisions">Stage
2: Agentic Tools with Line-by-Line Review → Course User Guides Encode
Design Decisions</h3>
<p>Course user guides capture design reasoning at the course level.
Faculty use compound ledgers to record what worked and what didn’t. But
faculty still gate every design decision — the guides inform, they don’t
generate.</p>
<p>This is analogous to Klaassen’s “gatekeeper” stage: the system has
knowledge, but humans approve or reject everything it suggests. For
Lilie, this means: the guides tell you <em>why</em> the DP1 dry run
exists, but a new faculty member still needs to design their own version
of it.</p>
<h3 id="stages-35-where-the-analogy-outruns-the-reality">Stages 3–5:
Where the Analogy Outruns the Reality</h3>
<p>Klaassen’s later stages describe a world where the system generates
code from plans (Stage 3), handles entire features autonomously (Stage
4), and runs parallel workstreams from the same compound base (Stage
5).</p>
<p>For software, this trajectory makes sense. For an educational
institution where the irreducible human element isn’t a bottleneck to
eliminate but <em>the actual product</em>, it’s not clear these stages
even apply — or that reaching them would be desirable. A system that can
“generate a learning experience from a plan” might produce something
that looks right on paper and feels hollow in the room. The later stages
of compound engineering optimize for removing the human from the loop.
The later stages of compound Lilie might need to optimize for
<em>keeping the human in the loop while making the loop
smarter</em>.</p>
<p>Worth imagining, not worth planning for. The real work is 0 → 1 →
2.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="what-each-transition-actually-requires">What Each Transition
Actually Requires</h3>
<p><strong>0 → 1 (where Lilie is now):</strong> Make existing principles
visible and referenced in design work. Ensure the Teaching Manifesto and
First Principles are actually consulted when designing courses, not just
acknowledged. This sounds trivial. It’s not — it requires faculty to see
these documents as <em>theirs</em>, not as institutional overhead.</p>
<p><strong>1 → 2:</strong> Build course user guides with compound
ledgers for every course. Establish the semester-end encoding ritual.
Create capability handoff contracts between courses. This is the
critical infrastructure step — and it’s the step that the 90/10
bandwidth problem makes hardest. The infrastructure doesn’t build
itself, and it doesn’t maintain itself either (see: The Cost of
Compounding, below).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-5-the-identity-question">Part 5: The Identity Question</h2>
<p>This is the hardest part. And it’s personal.</p>
<h3 id="the-engineering-version">The Engineering Version</h3>
<p>Klaassen writes: “Developers subconsciously see AI-assisted
development as an identity attack… the code was never really yours. It
belongs to the team, the product, and the users.” His reframe: “You did
the thinking. All the AI did was the writing.”</p>
<h3 id="the-lilie-version">The Lilie Version</h3>
<p>Course design is self-expression. The choices about what goes on a
slide, when to pause, how to phrase a prompt, when to pivot an activity
because you’re reading the room — these feel like craft. Like art.
Encoding them into a system feels like losing the thing that makes your
teaching <em>yours</em>.</p>
<p>This tension exists on two levels:</p>
<p><strong>The personal version.</strong> I’ve spent years developing
taste — about how to design an experience, how to read a room, how to
use language intentionally, how to create the conditions for
transformation. Encoding that taste into a document or a system feels
like it could flatten it. The compound ledger says “don’t over-explain
extreme users — the understanding comes from doing.” But the
<em>way</em> I don’t over-explain, the specific judgment call in the
moment, the reading of <em>this</em> room on <em>this</em> day — that’s
not encodable. Or is it?</p>
<p><strong>The cultural version.</strong> Faculty could see
systematization as threatening. If the system “knows” how to design a
Lilie course, what does that say about the faculty member’s role? If
course user guides encode design reasoning so well that a new faculty
member can deliver the experience, does that devalue the expertise of
the person who created it?</p>
<h3 id="the-voice-that-doesnt-want-this">The Voice That Doesn’t Want
This</h3>
<p>There is a faculty member — maybe real, maybe composite, but real
enough — who hears “compound system” and feels something between
skepticism and dread. Their teaching is a live performance. They’ve
spent a career learning to read a room, to feel when the energy shifts,
to know when to abandon the plan and follow the moment. Their best class
sessions weren’t designed — they emerged.</p>
<p>Asking them to write that down in a course user guide feels like
asking a jazz musician to notate their improvisation. The notation isn’t
the music. The guide isn’t the teaching. And the suggestion that it
<em>could be</em> — that someone else could read the guide and reproduce
the experience — isn’t liberating. It’s insulting. It says: what you do
isn’t as special as you think it is. It’s reducible. It’s transferable.
It’s <em>encodable</em>.</p>
<p>This person isn’t wrong. A lot of great teaching <em>is</em>
irreducible. The question is whether <em>all</em> of it is — or whether
some of what feels like irreducible craft is actually repeatable pattern
dressed up as intuition. The paper clip challenge works every time not
because of the faculty member’s in-the-moment genius, but because the
activity structure is good. That structure is encodable. The judgment
about <em>when to deploy it</em> and <em>how to adapt it to this
room</em> might not be.</p>
<p>The document needs to sit with this tension rather than resolve it.
The reframe below is available, but it won’t land for everyone — and
forcing it will create resistance that makes compounding harder, not
easier.</p>
<h3 id="the-reframe-for-those-ready-to-hear-it">The Reframe (For Those
Ready to Hear It)</h3>
<p>Klaassen’s answer: “You did the design thinking. The system just
executed the experience.”</p>
<p>The compound system doesn’t replace the faculty member’s judgment. It
replaces the <em>re-invention</em> that happens when judgment isn’t
captured. Every semester, every new faculty member, every new course
currently starts from a version of zero — informed by memory and
principles, but not by the accumulated design intelligence of everyone
who came before.</p>
<p>The liberating possibility: compound systems free you to do
<em>higher-order</em> design work. If the system handles the patterns —
the known-good activity structures, the proven language choices, the
tested assessment approaches — faculty attention goes to the things that
actually require human presence: reading this room, adapting to this
moment, seeing this student.</p>
<p>The system handles what <em>should be encoded</em>. The human handles
what <em>requires judgment</em>.</p>
<p>But here’s the honest caveat: this reframe works when the faculty
member trusts the system and had a hand in building it. Imposed from
above, a compound system feels like surveillance. Built collaboratively
— “we’re encoding <em>our</em> collective intelligence, not replacing
<em>your</em> individual expertise” — it might feel like something worth
contributing to. The difference between those two experiences is the
difference between a system that compounds and a system that gets
ignored.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The open question:</strong> Where is the line between
encodable design decisions and irreducible human judgment? And does that
line move as the system gets smarter? And who gets to decide where the
line is — the system designer, or the person whose judgment is being
encoded?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-6-the-main-loop-for-lilie">Part 6: The Main Loop for
Lilie</h2>
<p>Klaassen’s loop: <strong>Plan → Work → Review → Compound</strong></p>
<p>Lilie’s loop: <strong>Design → Teach → Assess → Encode →
Verify</strong></p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Strategic planning informed by encoded institutional knowledge. Not
starting from scratch, but from what the system already knows: what
worked, what didn’t, what the compound ledger says about this type of
activity or this point in the semester.</p>
<p>At the institutional level: which courses run, how they connect, what
the capability pipeline looks like, where the co-curricular programs
amplify the curricular ones.</p>
<h3 id="teach">Teach</h3>
<p>Running the semester. Courses, co-curriculars, mentorship,
competitions, speaker series. This is where 90% of energy currently goes
— and should. The teaching <em>is</em> the product.</p>
<p>But during teaching, <em>capture</em> happens. Session notes,
thinking notes, tic tocs, room-reading observations, TA sync
conversations. This raw material already exists. The compound question
is: does it go anywhere permanent?</p>
<h3 id="assess">Assess</h3>
<p>Multiple feedback channels, not just end-of-semester evaluations: -
Student reflections (DP1/DP2, Disco reflections) - Teaching evaluations
- TA observations and sync notes - Room-reading in real time - Outcomes
data (what did students actually become capable of?) - Gallery crits and
demo day performance - Peer feedback</p>
<p>Student reflections are underused as design intelligence. When 8 out
of 10 students say “I didn’t understand extreme users until I actually
observed one,” that’s not just assessment data — it’s a permanent design
lesson.</p>
<h3 id="encode">Encode</h3>
<p>The critical step. The semester-end ritual where lessons become
permanent design decisions.</p>
<p>What this looks like at the institutional level: - Course user guides
absorb specific design decisions — prescriptive, not descriptive. Not
“students struggled with X” but “do Y because students struggled with X
in Spring 2026.” - Capability handoff contracts update based on what
actually transferred between courses - The compound ledger records what
the system learned and when - The Teaching Manifesto stays constant
(identity); the design patterns evolve (practice)</p>
<p>This is the step that currently doesn’t happen systematically.
There’s no protected time for it, no ritual, no shared expectation that
encoding is part of the work.</p>
<h3 id="verify">Verify</h3>
<p>The missing piece in the current system. The systematic check: - Did
the encoded lessons actually change the design? - Did the changed design
actually change outcomes?</p>
<p>Without verification, encoding is just documentation. With it, the
system has a feedback loop that proves it’s compounding.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-compounding">The Cost of Compounding</h2>
<p>Klaassen’s article is an argument for compounding. It doesn’t spend
much time on the cost — because in software, the cost is relatively low.
Update CLAUDE.md, add a test, merge the PR. Done.</p>
<p>In an educational institution, the cost is higher and ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance is the hidden tax.</strong> Every compound
artifact — every course user guide, every capability handoff contract,
every entry in the compound ledger — requires upkeep. A guide that
described Spring 2026’s DP1 process accurately becomes misleading by
Fall 2026 if the process evolved and nobody updated the guide. A
capability handoff contract that says “Intro to Design produces
observation skills” but doesn’t reflect a recent curriculum change
creates false confidence downstream. A compound system that falls out of
sync with reality is worse than having no system at all, because people
trust it.</p>
<p>The 90/10 problem isn’t just about finding time to <em>build</em> the
compound system. It’s about the permanent commitment to
<em>maintain</em> it. Building a course user guide is a one-semester
project. Keeping it alive is a multi-year obligation. If Lilie can’t
protect time for that ongoing work, the compound system becomes another
artifact that was exciting to create and slowly becomes irrelevant — the
institutional equivalent of documentation that nobody reads because
nobody updates.</p>
<p><strong>Premature encoding creates rigidity.</strong> Not every
lesson from a semester deserves to be permanent. Some things worked
because of the specific students in the room, the specific moment in the
culture, the specific energy of a particular week. Encoding those
lessons as universal design decisions — “always do X” — creates rules
where there should be judgment calls. The compound system needs a way to
distinguish between lessons that are genuinely permanent (“the
understanding of extreme users comes from doing, not explaining”) and
lessons that were contextual (“this cohort responded well to Y”). Not
everything that worked should be encoded. Some things should just be
remembered.</p>
<p><strong>The system needs to know what it doesn’t know.</strong> A
compound ledger that only records successes and fixes — “we changed X
and it worked” — creates a false picture of certainty. It also needs to
record open questions, unresolved tensions, things that worked but
nobody is sure why. The most honest compound entry might be: “We tried Z
in Spring 2026. It seemed to work. We don’t know if it was the activity
or the cohort. Try it again in Fall 2026 and see.”</p>

define what Lilie <em>is</em>. These shouldn’t change often. They’re the
equivalent of a company’s mission statement — the thing you reference to
check whether a design decision is <em>ours</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The First Principles for Venture Creation at Lilie.</strong>
Pedagogical commitments specific to the venture creation courses. The
line between “how the game is played outside” and “what we do here”
should stay close.</p>
<h3 id="what-evolves-design-decisions">What Evolves — Design
Decisions</h3>
<p><strong>Course User Guides with Compound Ledgers.</strong> One per
course. Each guide captures the TLS lever decisions (Space, Language,
Activities, Assessment, Roles, Rituals) with the reasoning. The compound
ledger records what the course learned each semester — prescriptive
entries that accumulate into institutional design intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="what-connects-the-pipeline">What Connects — The Pipeline</h3>
<p><strong>Capability Handoff Contracts.</strong> Explicit agreements
about what each course produces and what the next one assumes. The
equivalent of API contracts between services.</p>
<p>Lilie runs many courses — not a single pipeline. But some students
take multiple courses over time, and when they do, each course’s output
becomes the next one’s input. The handoff contracts make those
connections visible rather than accidental. Here’s what one set of
connections might look like:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Course</th>
<th>Capability In</th>
<th>Capability Out</th>
<th>Compound Handoff</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Intro to Design</td>
<td>Curiosity, willingness</td>
<td>Observation, synthesis, navigating ambiguity, visual thinking</td>
<td>Can observe, frame problems, prototype, work in teams</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disco</td>
<td>Observation + synthesis skills</td>
<td>Self-awareness, ideation from personal values, venture instinct</td>
<td>Knows who they are as a builder, what problems they care about</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DBS</td>
<td>Self-awareness + venture instinct</td>
<td>Shipping capability, evidence-based iteration, builder identity</td>
<td>Can go from 0 → 1, ship to real users, make evidence-based
decisions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is one example, not the whole picture. The compound version
would map handoff contracts across all Lilie courses and co-curricular
programs — identifying where connections exist, where they’re assumed
but unverified, and where they’re missing entirely. The table updates
each semester based on what actually transferred and what didn’t.</p>
<h3 id="what-signals-shared-language">What Signals — Shared
Language</h3>
<p><strong>Language Guide.</strong> Not just a list of preferred words,
but the <em>reasons</em> behind each choice. “Builder” not “student”
because identity shapes behavior. “Ship” not “submit” because shipping
implies an audience and stakes. “Faculty” not “instructor” because
instruction is only one part of what we do.</p>
<p>Language choices are the most visible expression of institutional
taste. They’re also the easiest to compound — every new language
decision and its reasoning gets added to the guide.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-system-learned-the-institutional-compound-ledger">What
the System Learned — The Institutional Compound Ledger</h3>
<p>The meta-document. Every semester, what did the system learn? Not
what individual courses learned (that lives in course user guides), but
what Lilie <em>as a system</em> discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which capability handoffs worked and which didn’t</li>
<li>Where the co-curricular ecosystem amplified the curriculum and where
it was disconnected</li>
<li>What patterns emerged across multiple courses</li>
<li>What the portal network looks like and where it has gaps</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="part-8-provocations-and-open-questions">Part 8: Provocations and
Open Questions</h2>
<h3 id="the-5050-rule">The 50/50 Rule</h3>
<p>What if Lilie structurally protected time for system improvement? Not
“use your spare time to update course guides” but actual, scheduled,
compensated time allocated to compound work — capturing lessons,
updating guides, designing the connections between programs, verifying
that encoded changes made a difference.</p>
<p>What would Lilie’s version of the 50/50 rule look like? Maybe not
50/50 — maybe 80/20 or 70/30 — but <em>something</em> other than 90/10
with the 10 getting cut when the semester gets busy.</p>
<h3 id="who-designs-the-portal-network">Who Designs the Portal
Network?</h3>
<p>Principle VII says courses are “portals to the larger Lilie
community.” That’s compound thinking hiding in plain sight — it already
frames individual courses as nodes in a network. But who designs the
network? Who maps which portal connects to which? Who notices when a
portal is missing or when two portals could compound each other?</p>
<p>Faculty are just starting to design these connections. The question
is whether that work becomes structural or stays occasional.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-system-need-hesam-in-every-loop">Does the System Need
Hesam in Every Loop?</h3>
<p>If the system compounds enough, does it need me in the loop on every
design decision? The question is: “Is the scaffolding pattern itself
captured as a reusable design primitive I can deploy in Disco or
DBS?”</p>
<p>Some decisions require human judgment — reading the room, adapting in
the moment, seeing a specific student. Others could be encoded: the
order of activities, the language in a prompt, the assessment structure
for a particular type of assignment.</p>
<p>The compound question isn’t “can the system replace me?” It’s “what
does the system need me for, and what should it handle so I can focus on
what only I can do?”</p>
<h3 id="student-reflections-as-institutional-input">Student Reflections
as Institutional Input</h3>
<p>Student reflections are underused as design intelligence. Currently
they flow one direction: student → grade. The compound version:
reflections are systematically mined for design lessons at the
institutional level.</p>
<p>When patterns emerge across multiple courses — students consistently
say the same thing about navigating ambiguity, or about when they first
felt like a builder — that’s not just assessment data. That’s compound
input for the institutional system.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-questions">The Three Questions</h3>
<p>Klaassen asks three questions before accepting AI output: 1. What was
the hardest decision you made here? 2. What alternatives did you reject,
and why? 3. What are you least confident about?</p>
<p>What if these became standard questions in Lilie’s course design
process? Before a course design gets finalized for the semester, the
designing faculty answers these three questions. The answers become
permanent institutional knowledge about how design decisions get made —
not just <em>what</em> was decided, but <em>why</em>, and what the
alternatives were.</p>
<p>Over time, this accumulates into a rich archive of design reasoning
that any faculty member can reference. Not “here’s what to do” but
“here’s how people at Lilie think about design decisions, and here’s
what they’ve rejected and why.”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-provocation">The Provocation</h2>
<p>Every semester Lilie runs that doesn’t make the next semester’s
design permanently better <em>at the institutional level</em> is a
missed compounding opportunity. Individual courses may improve.
Individual faculty may grow. But the system — the machine that produces
learning experiences — stays roughly the same.</p>
<p>The question isn’t “are we getting better?” It’s: <strong>“What does
the system now know that it didn’t know before — and can anyone at Lilie
access that knowledge?”</strong></p>
